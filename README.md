# online-voting-system
An online voting system is needed to simplify the process of conducting elections and enable eligible voters to cast their votes conveniently through an online platform. The system should ensure the integrity, security, and privacy of the voting process, while also providing an efficient and user-friendly experience for voters,Developed using netbeans.

UDP Communication: The server uses a DatagramSocket to establish a connectionless communication channel via UDP. UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol suitable for scenarios where low overhead and quick data transmission are crucial.

Packet Reception: The server continuously listens for incoming DatagramPacket objects. When a packet is received, it prints information about the client's IP header, extracts data from the packet, and performs checksum verification.

Checksum Verification: The code uses a simple CRC32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check) algorithm for checksum verification. The verifyChecksum method checks if the received checksum matches the calculated checksum. This helps ensure the integrity of the data received.

Data Processing: The received data is then processed. In this case, the code expects the data to contain a username, candidate name, and checksum. It splits the data into parts and verifies the checksum before proceeding with storing candidate information in a MySQL database.

Database Interaction: The storeCandidateInDatabase method connects to a MySQL database using JDBC. It updates the candidate name in the database for a specific username.

Error Handling: The code includes TODO comments for handling various scenarios, such as invalid packet formats, checksum mismatches, and potential responses to clients.
